## 🧠 Overview

**Obsidian** is a Windows-based knowledge management application focused on building interconnected notes stored locally on your computer. It allows users to create a personal knowledge base where ideas are linked together in a way that mirrors natural thinking.

The application is centered around plain-text Markdown files, giving users full ownership and long-term control over their notes. Links between notes form a network of concepts, making it easy to explore relationships, revisit ideas, and develop deeper understanding over time.

Obsidian is widely used for research, writing, planning, and learning. Its flexible structure supports both simple note-taking and complex knowledge systems, making it a powerful tool for Windows users who value clarity, control, and long-term organization.
